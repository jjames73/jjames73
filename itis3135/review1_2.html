<strong>Further feedback:</strong>
<li>Other than the readability of the website being a bit difficult read due to the size of the bodys font and the bright red used for the h elements the website is well made. The font size and text color are easy fixes such as opting for a darker red and exchanging the pages title to use your tan text instead of the red. Your use repetition, alignment and proximity is amazing especially with how well you placed your pictures.</li>
