<strong>Further feedback:</strong>
<li>Other than the readability of the website is a bit difficult to read due to the size of the bodys font and the bright red used for the h elements the website is well made. The font size and text color are easy fixes such as opting for a darker red and exchanging the pages title to use your tan text instead of the red. Your use repetition, alignment and proximity is amazing especially with how well you placed your pictures.</li>

    The website is consistent through every page in terms of style. The only problem I had was with the bright green used in the header. Green as a color can still be used but it would be better to have it be a dark forest green to present greater contrast with the white letters used. There also seems to be a HTML warning being shown by accumulus for your contact page. The warning only addresses your use of camel case in your form id. Other than those two small details your website is clean and does what it needs to do.
